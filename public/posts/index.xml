      <description>The experience of introducing agile practices into a reactive Operations team. Why &amp;ldquo;NOC’er&amp;rdquo;? In our Ops team, we term ourselves as in the “NOC” or “Network Operations Center”. We “belong to the NOC”, we are “on the NOC”, we are “NOC’ing” or we are “NOC’ers”. I just want to point out that the term NOC can sometimes be mistakenly limited to those working on networky-type issues only. Our team is much broader than that, encompassing all the tasks that a mature SaaS Operations team does.</description>
